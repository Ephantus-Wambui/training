# Orientation

## Tour of Gitpod

If you haven't yet, log into the [![Nextflow Training GitPod](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-%20Open%20in%20Gitpod-908a85?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nextflow-io/training), which provides a virtual machine with everything already set up for you.

In the Gitpod window, you'll see a terminal. Type the following command to switch to the folder of this training material:

```bash
cd /workspace/gitpod/hello-nextflow
```

Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the gitpod environment, especially the file explorer, file browser and terminal.

## Pipeline data and scripts

We provide all test data, code and accessory needed to work through this training module. To view a full list, run the following command in the Gitpod terminal:

```bash
tree /workspace/gitpod/hello-nextflow
```

You should see the following output:

### Description of contents

**The `data` directory** contains the input data we'll use in Part 2: Hello GATK, which uses an example from genomics to demonstrate how to build a simple analysis pipeline. The data is described in detail in that section of the training.

**The `scripts` directory** contains the completed workflow scripts that result from each step of the tutorial and are intended to be used as a reference to check your work. The name and number in the filename correspond to the step of the relevant tutorial. For example, the file `hello-world-4.nf` is the expected result of completing steps 1 through 4 of Part 1: Hello World.

**The file `greetings.txt`** is a plain text file used to provide inputs in Part 1: Hello World.

**The file `hello-gatk.nf`** is a stub that serves as a starting point to Part 2: Hello GATK. In its initial state, it is NOT a functional workflow script.

**The file `hello-world.nf`** is a simple but fully functional workflow script that serves as a starting point to Part 1: Hello World.

**The file `nextflow.config`** is a configuration file that sets minimal environment properties.
